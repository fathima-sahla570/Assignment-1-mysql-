This assignment explores the fundamental concepts of Database Definition Language (DDL) commands in SQL using a practical scenario of managing a student database. The tasks involve creating a database and a table, performing various DDL operations such as modifying the structure of the table, renaming it, and eventually deleting it. Through these steps, learners will gain hands-on experience with essential database operations.

The assignment is designed to strengthen the understanding of the following key SQL concepts:

CREATE: To define a new database and table.
ALTER: To modify the structure of an existing table by adding or removing columns.
DROP: To remove a table entirely.
RENAME: To change the name of a table.
TRUNCATE: To delete all rows in a table without removing its structure.
By working through these exercises, learners will also practice using the SELECT statement to retrieve data, ensuring they can view and verify changes made to the database. This assignment simulates real-world database management tasks in an academic context.
